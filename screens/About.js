            Shares of the giant tech companies tumbled on Monday, pushing major
            stock market indexes into negative territory for November and
            leaving investors clinging to a gain of less than 1 percent for the
            year.

            Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft were all down by more than 3
            percent shortly after midday, as investors digested a series of
            negative reports that suggested they face growing risks to their
            extraordinary pipeline of profits.

            In an interview with Axios, Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple,
            called new regulations for the tech sector “inevitable.” That
            prospect could significantly raise compliance costs for tech firms
            and potentially weigh on profits of the iPhone maker as well as
            other large, dominant tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft.
            Facebook has already seen its share price plummet after it reported
            that it significantly increased the amount it spends on security.

            The beauty in opening with “tell me about yourself” is that it
            allows you to start a conversation without the fear that you’re
            going to inadvertently make someone uncomfortable or self-conscious.
            Posing a broad question lets people lead you to who they are. As an
            interviewer, Ms. Gross’s goal is to find out how her subject became
            who they are; as a conversationalist, make that goal your own.
