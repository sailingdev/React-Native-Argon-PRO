            It all started in the early 1970s, when, floundering a bit in her
            post-college life, she landed a gig at WBFO, a radio station in
            Buffalo. There she would call subjects and interview them for the
            program she hosted, “This Is Radio.” She moved to Philadelphia in
            1975 to host “Fresh Air,” the brainchild of a colleague from WBFO.

            Ms. Gross brings a combination of empathy and rigorous preparation
            to the job. “I read, watch or listen to as much of the person’s work
            as possible, so I have an understanding of what makes them, or their
            story, important,” she said. “I try to clarify in my own mind why
            this person matters, and why it’s worthy of our listeners’ time.”

            One thing she does not allow of her interview subjects, however, is
            input on the edit. “When the interview is over, you don’t have a
            chance to call back and say, ‘Well I like my answer to this, I don’t
            like my answer to that, can you edit that out,” she said. (As
            someone who has been interviewed by Ms. Gross, I would like to say
            that I wish I hadn’t insisted that her cats hate her. That said, I
            never asked for my comment to be removed from that particular
            episode of “Fresh Air.”)
