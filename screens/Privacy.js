            In recent months, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft and others have
            aggressively lobbied officials in the Trump administration and
            elsewhere to start outlining a federal privacy law, according to
            administration officials and the companies. The law would have a
            dual purpose, they said: It would overrule the California law and
            instead put into place a kinder set of rules that would give the
            companies wide leeway over how personal digital information was
            handled.

            “We are committed to being part of the process and a constructive
            part of the process,” said Dean Garfield, president of a leading
            tech industry lobbying group, the Information Technology Industry
            Council, which is working on proposals for the federal law. “The
            best way is to work toward developing our own blueprint.”

            The efforts could set up a big fight with consumer and privacy
            groups, especially as companies like Facebook face scrutiny for
            mishandling users’ personal data. Many of the internet companies
            depend on the collection and analysis of such data to help them
            target the online ads that generate the bulk of their revenue.

            At a board meeting for the Information Technology Industry Council
            in May, Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s top lobbyist, warned that an early
            proposal for privacy in California posed a threat to the industry
            and that the trade group needed to make the issue of privacy a
            priority, according to two people briefed on the meeting, who were
            not authorized to speak publicly.
